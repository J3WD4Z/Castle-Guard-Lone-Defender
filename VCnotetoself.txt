- Open Level Motion Controller Map

- Check to see if SteamVR is working

- Firing System: put hand to center of bow, press trigger to spawn arrow, then draw and release trigger to fire arrow.

- In Variables panel, you can select image on left side to decide Pin Type. This can be helpful if a reference does not fit.

- Some individual files may be too big for regular git to push properly. Try installing git lfs in that case. Current files that have caused this problem are: 
	. Oversized .log files, probably in BowsNArrows\Saved\Logs
